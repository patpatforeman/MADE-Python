# how well do you know your operators?
# you can add each variable into the print function below
# to check you work, like so:
# print(frst_num)

# multiply two factors of 64
frst_num = 0

# divide frst_num by 10
scnd_num = frst_num

# add scnd_num to frst_num, then subtract 2
thrd_num = scnd_num

# now, using parentheses, divide scnd_num by 2, then multiply it by 20, and finally add 2.4
frth_num = scnd_num

# think of two different ways to raise 8 to the 2nd power
# hint, for one of them you have to import a module discussed in class
sqwr_num1 = 8
sqwr_num2 = 8

# challenge question: how are sqwr_num1 and sqwr_num2 different?
# enter which one is more accurate below:
accurate = 0
