# This is a "python module" that essentially brings in
# fancier math operations
import math

# Here is how to do powers the fancy way:
# The first input is the value you want, and the second is the
# power you want to raise it to. i.e. 5^2
power = math.pow(5, 2)
print("5 squared is: " + str(power))

# Same goes for the square root!
# This only needs the number
root = math.sqrt(25)
print("The square root of 25 is: " + str(root))
