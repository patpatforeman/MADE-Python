# This is an introduction to variables
# A variable is a container for information

# For Example:
num_one = 5

# num is now equal to five. Let's see what happens when we print it:
print(num_one)

# Let's make another variable:
num_two = 10

# Can we do math with these??
print(num_one + num_two)

# Check this out:
summation = num_one + num_two
print(summation)

# If you want to print out a number alongside some text,
# you have to "concatenate" them after making the number text.
# (concatenate means to add strings together)
# Shown below is how to do so, using the summation variable:
print("num_one plus num_two is: " + str(summation))

# In summary, variables act as whatever they are assigned to,
# and can oftentimes be treated as substitutions to numbers
